        "\n",
        "In this portfolio, we are going to implement the Rescorla-Wagner model to simulate the behavior of agents interacting with environments that can have different levels of volatility. The Rescorla-Wagner model is a model of classical conditioning in which learning occurs in response to a prediction error. The model itself is a simple algebraic equation describing how associative values between a stimulus and an outcome are updated via error correction. \n",
